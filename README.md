# React-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in full-stack web development, utilizing a robust tech stack. On the front end, I employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, integrating various APIs for enhanced functionality. For server-side development, I use Node.js and Express.js to build scalable and efficient RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints. On the backend, I leverage MongoDB and PostgreSQL for data management, utilizing Mongoose for MongoDB and Sequelize for PostgreSQL to streamline database interactions. This comprehensive stack enables me to deliver complete, high-quality web applications.
